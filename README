statb - simple info output
==========================
statb is a utility to edit the WM_NAME property of the root X window. This is
what dwm and other simple window managers read to display a simple textual bar
on screen. statb takes advantage of this to provide a modular method of adding
different pieces of useful information, such as audio volume, battery charge,
and internet connectivity.

Requirements
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install statb (if
necessary, as root):

    make clean install


Running statb
-------------
Add the following line the your .xinitrc to start statb using startx:

    statb &


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of statb is done by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure, and simple.
