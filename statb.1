.TH STATB 1 statb\-VERSION
.SH NAME
statb \- simple info output
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBstatb\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstatb\fR(1) is a utility to edit the \fIWM_NAME\fR property of the root
\fBxorg\fR(1) window.  This is what \fBdwm\fR(1) and other simple window
managers read to display a simple textual bar on screen.  \fBstatb\fR(1) takes
advantage of this to provide a modular method of adding different pieces of
useful information, such as audio volume, battery charge, and internet
connectivity.
.SH USAGE
\fBstatb\fR(1) can be run by adding it into to your \fI.xinitrc\fR file.  It
can alternatively be started while a window manager is already running.
.SH CUSTOMISATION
\fBstatb\fR(1) is customised by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling
the source code.  This keeps it fast, secure, and simple.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBdwm\fR(1), \fBxinit\fR(1), \fBxorg\fR(1)
.SH BUGS
\fBstatb\fR(1) will sometimes crash when switching to another tty.
.PP
\fBstatb\fR(1) seems to not work on some systems.  Similarities between these
systems normally include not having batteries (required for the battery module)
and not using ALSA for the main audio control.  If these modules are removed,
\fBstatb\fR(1) should function normally.
